# Application Configuration Extractor (ACE)
The Application Configuration Extractor (ACE for short) is a tool that extracts the front end build process out of your project so you don't have to worry about managing dependencies and build configuration.

By using ACE in all your projects, developers ensure that no matter what project they're working on, the setup will be familiar to them and feel natural/consistent.
